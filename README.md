# airbnb-clone-project
Overview
This project is a clone of the popular lodging service AirBnB. The goal is to build a simplified version of the platform, covering key features such as user authentication, property listings, bookings, and reviews.

Tech Stack
1. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js or similar framework)

2. Backend: Python (Flask or Django)

3. Database: MySQL or PostgreSQL

4. Version Control: Git & GitHub

5. Deployment: (TBD - possibly AWS, Heroku, or similar)

Project Goals
1. Implement user authentication (signup, login, logout).

2. Allow users to create, view, update, and delete property listings.

3. Enable booking functionality with date selection.

4. Include a review system for properties.

5. Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes.

UI/UX Design Planning:
Design Goals
1. Intuitive Navigation: Users should easily browse properties without confusion.

2. Visual Appeal: Clean, modern aesthetics with high-quality images.

3. Mobile-First Approach: Responsive design for all devices.

4. Fast & Seamless Booking: Minimize steps for a smooth checkout process.

Key Features
✔️ Search & filtering options (price, location, amenities)
✔️ Interactive property gallery with high-res images
✔️ Booking calendar with availability indicators
✔️ Guest reviews & ratings system
✔️ Secure & simple checkout flow

Importance of Design Properties in Mockups
Consistency - Predefined colors/fonts ensure visual harmony across all screens

Developer Handoff - Exact values streamline CSS implementation

Brand Identity - Maintains cohesive look aligning with AirBnB's aesthetic

Responsive Adaptation - Typography scales predictably across devices

Accessibility - Contrast ratios and font sizes meet WCAG standards


Project Roles and Responsibilities
The success of the AirBnB Clone project relies on clearly defined roles and collaborative teamwork. The Project Manager oversees timelines, coordinates cross-functional efforts, and mitigates risks to ensure on-track delivery. Frontend Developers build responsive user interfaces using React.js, while Backend Developers develop APIs and business logic with Python/Django, ensuring seamless data flow. UI/UX Designers craft intuitive wireframes and maintain design consistency in Figma, directly supporting frontend implementation. QA/Testers validate functionality through automated and manual testing, safeguarding release quality. DevOps Engineers configure AWS infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) for efficient deployments. The Product Owner prioritizes features and refines the backlog based on stakeholder feedback, while the Scrum Master facilitates Agile ceremonies (daily standups, sprint reviews) to optimize workflows. Regular syncs between teams—such as API contract reviews (Backend ↔ Frontend) and design handoffs (UI ↔ Frontend)—ensure alignment. Together, these roles create a streamlined process from ideation to deployment, balancing technical excellence with user-centric outcomes.
